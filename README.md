# My Personal Portfolio

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project showcasing my personal portfolio, built with modern technologies such as Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to view the portfolio.

You can start customizing the portfolio by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures seamless viewing across devices.
- **Interactive Animations**: Powered by Framer Motion for a dynamic user experience.
- **Custom Styling**: Tailored with Tailwind CSS for modular and efficient styling.
- **Fast Performance**: Optimized with Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation.
